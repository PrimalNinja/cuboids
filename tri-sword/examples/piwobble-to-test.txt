# Mori's Program vs. DH Discretization: Tri-Sword Fine-Tune

## 1. Objective

To validate if a 3D spherical projection of the modular space (using Shigefumi Mori's Minimal Model principles) identifies vertex "Corners" with higher efficiency than traditional 2D polygon mapping.

## 2. Core Test Parameters

* **Target Hardware:** NVIDIA Tesla T4 (FP32/INT32 Register Audit)
* **Mathematical Framework:** Algebraic Varieties (Birational Geometry / 3D Riemann Sphere)
* **Baseline:** Tri-Sword Audit Phase II (5.6359x Wobble)

## 3. Phase VII-A: Coalesced Singularity Scan

* Map residues to a 3D grid using **Nonoid (81-point) topology** (9 planes × 9 points = 81 elements)
* Align the **Primary Vertex (Addr 5392)** to L1 cache boundaries for maximum memory coalescing (Tri-Sword Section 1)
* Detect singularities at cache-line granularity — wobble becomes measurable at hardware level
* **Metric:** Calculate the concentration of Primary Vertex (Addr 5392) in 3D space

## 4. Phase VII-B: Branchless Geodesic Inversion

* Solve **p = 2^64** as a Ternary Flow problem (Water Physics — Tri-Sword Section 5)
* Signal propagates through ground state (0), blocked by walls (1)
* Replace IF/THEN pathfinding with **Predicate Logic masks** for zero warp divergence (Tri-Sword Section 6.5)
* Use geodesic calculation instead of Pollard's Rho random walk — direct geometric inversion
* **Metric:** Solve discrete log for **p = 2^64** using geometric intersection rather than probabilistic search

## 5. Phase VII-C: TinyFloat Wobble Map

* Encode 3D precision offsets as **int8_t (-40 to +40)** using TinyFloat mathematics (Tri-Sword Section 6.6)
* Fit entire 3D fracture map into **48KB Shared Memory** (L1 cache residency = <30 cycle latency)
* Compare VRAM consumption: 3D spherical lookup table vs. 2D "Jagged Polygon" at same bit-depth
* **Tri-Sword Metric:** Target **4,500+ cells/µs** for geometric inversion pulse (matches maze solver peak performance)

## 6. The "Mori Constraint" Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** By applying Mori's Program, we can find the "Minimal Model" of the DH group. If the "Silicon Polygon" is regular, knowing 3 high-resonance vertices in a 3D variety allows for the calculation of the entire group structure via rotation.

### Validation Questions:

* Is the "Silicon Polygon" regular? → Measure vertex spacing in 3D
* Does knowing 3 high-resonance vertices reveal all? → Apply rotation to predict unseen vertices
* Is the "Law of the Wobble" a 3D invariant? → Check if pattern persists across coordinate transformations

**Target:** Determine if the "Law of the Wobble" is a 3D geometric invariant.

## 7. Phase VII Execution Sequence

| **Phase** | **Action** | **Metric** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **VII-A** | Run coalesced singularity scan | Vertex concentration in L1 cache |
| **VII-B** | Implement geodesic inversion | Time to solve **p = 2^64** |
| **VII-C** | Build TinyFloat wobble map | Memory usage <48KB |
